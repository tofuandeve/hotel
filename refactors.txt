1. Naming:
    - Replacing start_date with checkin_date, end_date with checkout_date. 
    - Find a better name for @room_reservation_data 
    
2. Implementation
    - Refactor HotelSystem class to reduce dependency on other classes (DateRange, HotelBlock, Reservation)
    - Should HotelBlock be removed?
    - Should there be a Rate class? or Room class where rate will be passed in to constructor as argument?
    - Implement read_data() and write_data() methods for @room_reservation_data and @hotel_blocks
    - Create main.rb to interact with HotelSystem
